# Example showing all possible functionality

This shows most of the functionality of the library at once.
It has code in it for every possible sensor and modem and for both AVR and SAMD boards.
This example should *never* be used directly; it is intended to document all possibilities and to verify compilating.

To create your own code, I recommend starting from a much simpler targeted example, like the [Logging to MMW](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/logging_to_MMW) example, and then adding to it based on only the parts of this menu example that apply to you.

## Defines and Includes

### Defines for the Arduino IDE
The top few lines of the examples set defines of buffer sizes and yields needed for the Arduino IDE.
That IDE read any defines within the top few lines and applies them as build flags for the processor.
This is _not_ standard behavior for C++ (which is what Arduino code really is) - this is a unique aspect of the Arduino IDE.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{defines} )

If you are using PlatformIO, you should instead set these as global build flags in your platformio.ini.
This is standard behaviour for C++.

```ini
build_flags =
    -DSDI12_EXTERNAL_PCINT
    -DNEOSWSERIAL_EXTERNAL_PCINT
    -DMQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE=240
    -DTINY_GSM_RX_BUFFER=64
    -DTINY_GSM_YIELD_MS=2

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_serial_ports Extra Serial Ports )
### Extra Serial Ports

This section of the example has all the code to create and link to serial ports for both AVR and SAMD based boards.
The EnviroDIY Mayfly, the Arduino Mega, UNO, and Leonardo are all AVR boards.
The Arduino Zero, the M0 and the Sodaq Autonomo are all SAMD boards.

Many different sensors communicate using some sort of serial or transistor-transistor-logic (TTL) protocol.
Among these are any sensors using RS232, RS485, RS422.
Generally each serial variant (or sometimes each sensor) needs a dedicated serial "port" - its own connection to the processor.
Most processors have built in dedicated wires for serial communication - "Hardware" serial.
See the page on [Arduino streams](@ref page_arduino_streams) for much more detail about serial connections with Arduino processors.
_______

[//]: # ( @subsubsection menu_avr_serial_ports AVR Boards )
#### AVR Boards

Most Arduino AVR style boards have very few (ie, one, or none) dedicated serial ports _available_ after counting out the programming serial port.
So to connect anything else, we need to try to emulate the processor serial functionality with a software library.
This example shows three possible libraries that can be used to emulate a serial port on an AVR board.


[//]: # ( @paragraph menu_altsoftseral AltSoftSerial )
##### AltSoftSerial

[AltSoftSerial](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/AltSoftSerial) by Paul Stoffregen is the most accurate software serial port for AVR boards.
AltSoftSerial can only be used on one set of pins on each board so only one AltSoftSerial port can be used.
Not all AVR boards are supported by AltSoftSerial.
See the [processor compatibility](@ref page_processor_compatibility) page for more information on which pins are used on supported boards.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{altsoftserial} )


[//]: # ( @paragraph menu_neoswserial NeoSWSerial )
##### NeoSWSerial

[NeoSWSerial](https://github.com/SRGDamia1/NeoSWSerial) is the best software serial that can be used on any pin supporting interrupts.
You can use as many instances of NeoSWSerial as you want.
Each instance requires two pins, one for data in and another for data out.
If you only want to use the serial line for incoming or outgoing data, set the other pin to -1.
Not all AVR boards are supported by NeoSWSerial.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{neoswserial} )

When using NeoSWSerial we will also have to actually set the data receiving (Rx) pin modes for interrupt in the [setup function](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_setup_serial_interrupts).


[//]: # ( @paragraph menu_softwareseraial SoftwareSerial with External Interrupts )
##### SoftwareSerial with External Interrupts

The "standard" software serial library uses interrupts that conflict with several other libraries used within this program.
I've created a [version of software serial that has been stripped of interrupts](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/SoftwareSerial_ExtInts) but it is still far from ideal.
This should be used only use if necessary.
It is not a very accurate serial port!

Accepting its poor quality, you can use as many instances of SoftwareSerial as you want.
Each instance requires two pins, one for data in and another for data out.
If you only want to use the serial line for incoming or outgoing data, set the other pin to -1.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{softwareserial} )

When using SoftwareSerial with External Interrupts we will also have to actually set the data receiving (Rx) pin modes for interrupt in the [setup function](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_setup_serial_interrupts).


[//]: # ( @paragraph menu_softwarewire Software I2C/Wire )
##### Software I2C/Wire

This creates a software I2C (wire) instance that can be shared between multiple sensors.
Only Testato's [SoftwareWire](https://github.com/Testato/SoftwareWire) library is supported.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{softwarewire} )

---

[//]: # ( @subsubsection menu_samd_serial_ports SAMD Boards )
#### SAMD Boards

The SAMD21 supports up to 6 _hardware_ serial ports, which is _awesome_.
But, the Arduino core doesn't make use of all of them, so we have to assign them ourselves.

This section of code assigns SERCOM's 1 and 2 to act as Serial2 and Serial3 on pins 10/11 and 5/2 respectively.
These pin selections are based on the Adafruit Feather M0.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{serial_ports_SAMD} )

In addition to creating the extra SERCOM ports here, the pins must be set up as the proper pin peripherals after the serial ports are begun.
This is shown in the [SAMD Pin Peripherals section](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_setup_pin_periph) of the setup function.


NOTE:  The SAMD51 board has an amazing _8_ available SERCOM's, but I do not have any exmple code for using them.

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_logger_opts Logging Options )
### Logging Options

Here we set options for the logging and dataLogger object.
This includes setting the time zone (daylight savings time is **NOT** applied) and setting all of the input and output pins related to the logger.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{logging_options} )
___


[//]: # ( @section menu_modem_settings Wifi/Cellular Modem Options )
## Wifi/Cellular Modem Options

This modem section is very lengthy because it contains the code with the constructor for every possible supported modem module.
Do _NOT_ try to use more than one modem at a time - it will _NOT_ work.

To create any of the modems, we follow a similar pattern:

First, we'll create a pointer to the serial port (Arduino Stream object) that we'll use for communication between the modem and the MCU.
We also assign the baud rate to a variable here.
There is a table of @ref modem_notes_bauds on the @ref page_modem_notes page.
The baud rate of any of the modules can be changed using AT commands or the `modem.gsmModem.setBaud(uint32_t baud)` function.

Next, we'll assign all the pin numbers for all the other pins connected between the modem and the MCU.
Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.
There is a table of general @ref modem_notes_sleep and @ref modem_notes_mayfly_pins on the @ref page_modem_notes page.

All the modems also need some sort of network credentials for internet access.
For WiFi modems, you need the network name and password (assuming WPA2).
For cellular models, you will need the APN assigned to you by the carrier you bought your SIM card from.


[//]: # ( @subsection menu_xbee_cell_trans Digi XBee Cellular )
### Digi XBee Cellular - Transparent Mode

This is the code to use for _any_ of Digi's cellular XBee or XBee3 modules.
All of them can be implented as a DigiXBeeCellularTransparent object - a subclass of DigiXBee and loggerModem.
To create a DigiXBeeCellularTransparent object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the MCU pin connected to the status pin,
- whether the status pin is the true status pin (`ON/SLEEP_N/DIO9`) or the `CTS_N/DIO7` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RESET_N`pin,
- the `DTR_N/SLEEP_RQ/DIO8` pin,
- and the SIM card's cellular access point name (APN).

@note  The u-blox based Digi XBee's (3G global and LTE-M global) may be more stable used in bypass mode (below).
The Telit based Digi XBees (LTE Cat1 both Verizon and AT&T) can only use this mode.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{xbee_cell_transparent} )

Depending on your cellular carrier, it is best to select the proper carrier profile and network.
Setting these helps the modem to connect to network faster.
This is shows in the [XBee Cellular Carrier](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_setup_xbeec_carrier) chunk of the setup function.


[//]: # ( @subsection menu_xbee_ltem_by Digi XBee3 LTE-M Bypass )
### Digi XBee3 LTE-M - Bypass Mode

This code is for Digi's LTE-M XBee3 based on the u-blox SARA R410M - used in bypass mode.
To create a DigiXBeeLTEBypass object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the MCU pin connected to the status pin,
- whether the status pin is the true status pin (`ON/SLEEP_N/DIO9`) or the `CTS_N/DIO7` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RESET_N`pin,
- the `DTR_N/SLEEP_RQ/DIO8` pin,
- and the SIM card's cellular access point name (APN).

Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{xbee3_ltem_bypass} )

Depending on your cellular carrier, it is best to select the proper carrier profile and network.
Setting these helps the modem to connect to network faster.
This is shows in the [SARA R4 Cellular Carrier](@ref setup_r4_carrrier) chunk of the setup function.


[//]: # ( @subsubsection menu_digi_3gby Digi XBee 3G - Bypass Mode )
### Digi XBee 3G - Bypass Mode

This code is for Digi's 3G/2G XBee based on the u-blox SARA U201 - used in bypass mode.
To create a DigiXBee3GBypass object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the MCU pin connected to the status pin,
- whether the status pin is the "true" status pin (`ON/SLEEP_N/DIO9`) or the `CTS_N/DIO7` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RESET_N`pin,
- the `DTR_N/SLEEP_RQ/DIO8` pin,
- and the SIM card's cellular access point name (APN).

Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{xbee_3g_bypass} )


[//]: # ( @subsection menu_xbee_wifi Digi XBee S6B Wifi )
### Digi XBee S6B Wifi

This code is for the Digi's S6B wifi module.
To create a DigiXBeeWifi object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the MCU pin connected to the status pin,
- whether the status pin is the "true" status pin (`ON/SLEEP_N/DIO9`) or the `CTS_N/DIO7` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RESET_N`pin,
- the `DTR_N/SLEEP_RQ/DIO8` pin,
- the wifi access point name,
- and the wifi WPA2 password.

Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{xbee_wifi} )


[//]: # ( @subsection menu_esp Espressif ESP8266 )
### Espressif ESP8266

This code is for the Espressif ESP8266 or ESP32 operating with "AT" firmware.
To create a EspressifESP8266 object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the light sleep status pin (on both ESP and MCU),
- the reset pin (MCU pin connected to the ESP's `RSTB/DIO16`),
- the light sleep wake pin (on both the ESP and the MCU),
- the wifi access point name,
- and the wifi WPA2 password.

Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{esp8266} )

Because the ESP8266's default baud rate is too fast for an 8MHz board like the Mayfly, to use it you need to drop the baud rate down for sucessful communication.
You can set the slower baud rate using some external method, or useing the code from the ESP8266 Baud Rate(https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_setup_esp) part of the setup function below.


[//]: # ( @subsection menu_bg96 Quectel BG96 )
### Quectel BG96

This code is for the Dragino, Nimbelink or other boards based on the Quectel BG96.
To create a QuectelBG96 object we need to know

- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the MCU pin connected to the `STATUS` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RESET_N` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `PWRKEY` pin (for sleep request),
- and the SIM card's cellular access point name (APN).

Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{bg96} )

If you are interfacing with a Nimbelink Skywire board via the Skywire development board, you also need to handle the fact that the development board reverses the levels of the status, wake, and reset pins.
Code to invert the pin levels is in the [Skywire Pin Inversions](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_setup_skywire) part of the setup function below.


[//]: # ( @subsection menu_monarch Sequans Monarch )
### Sequans Monarch

This code is for the Nimbelink LTE-M Verizon/Sequans or other boards based on the Sequans Monarch series SoC.
To create a SequansMonarch object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the MCU pin connected to either the `GPIO3/STATUS_LED` or `POWER_MON` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RESETN` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RTS` or `RTS0` pin (for sleep request),
- and the SIM card's cellular access point name (APN).

Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{monarch} )

If you are interfacing with a Nimbelink Skywire board via the Skywire development board, you also need to handle the fact that the development board reverses the levels of the status, wake, and reset pins.
Code to invert the pin levels is in the [Skywire Pin Inversions](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_setup_skywire) part of the setup function below.

The default baud rate of the SVZM20 is much too fast for almost all Arduino boards.
_Before_ attampting to connect a SVZM20 to an Arduino you should connect it to your computer and use AT commands to decrease the baud rate.
The proper command to decrease the baud rate to 9600 (8N1) is: `AT+IPR=9600`.


[//]: # ( @subsection menu_sim800 SIMCom SIM800 )
### SIMCom SIM800

This code is for a SIMCom SIM800 or SIM900 or one of their many variants, including the Adafruit Fona and the Sodaq 2GBee R4.
To create a SIMComSIM800 object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power,
- the MCU pin connected to the `STATUS` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `RESET` pin,
- the MCU pin connected to the `PWRKEY` pin (for sleep request),
- and the SIM card's cellular access point name (APN).

Pins that do not apply should be set as -1.

_NOTE:_  This is NOT the correct form for a Sodaq 2GBee R6 or R7.
See the  section for a 2GBee R6.

### Sodaq GPRSBee

This code is for the Sodaq 2GBee R6 and R7 based on the SIMCom SIM800.
To create a Sodaq2GBeeR6 object we need to know
- the serial object name,
- the MCU pin controlling modem power, (**NOTE:**  On the GPRSBee R6 and R7 the pin labeled as ON/OFF in Sodaq's diagrams is tied to _both_ the SIM800 power supply and the (inverted) SIM800 `PWRKEY`.
You should enter this pin as the power pin.)

Depending on your cellular carrier, it is best to select the proper carrier profile and network.
Setting these helps the modem to connect to network faster.
This is shows in the [SARA R4 Cellular Carrier](@ref setup_r4_carrrier) chunk of the setup function.

### u-blox SARA U201

This code is for modules based on the 3G/2G u-blox SARA U201 including the Sodaq UBee or the Sodaq 3GBee.
To create a SodaqUBeeU201 object we need to know

### Modem Measured Variables

After creating the modem object, we can create Variable objects for each of the variables the modem is capable of measuring (Modem_SignalPercent, Modem_BatteryState, Modem_BatteryPercent, Modem_BatteryVoltage, and Modem_Temp).
When we create the modem-linked variable objects, the first argument of the constructor, the loggerModem to like the variables to is required.
The second and third arguments (the UUID and the variable code) included here are optional.
Note that here we create the variables for anything measured by _any_ of the modems, but most modems are not capable of measuring all of the values.
Some modem-measured values may be meaningless depending on the board configuration - often the battery parameters returned by a cellular component have little meaning because the module is downstream of a voltage regulator.

### The processor as a sensor

Set options and create the objects for using the processor as a sensor to report battery level, processor free ram, and sample number.

The processor can return the number of "samples" it has taken, the amount of RAM it has available and, for some boards, the battery voltage (EnviroDIY Mayfly, Sodaq Mbili, Ndogo, Autonomo, and One, Adafruit Feathers).
The version of the board is required as input (ie, for a EnviroDIY Mayfly: "v0.3" or "v0.4" or "v0.5").
Use a blank value (ie, "") for un-versioned boards.
Please note that while you can opt to average more than one sample, it really makes no sense to do so for the processor.
The number of "samples" taken will increase by one for each time another processor "measurement" is taken so averaging multiple measurements from the processor will result in the number of samples increasing by more than one with each loop.

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_atlas_sensors Atlas Scientific EZO Circuits )
### Atlas Scientific EZO Circuits

The next several sections are for Atlas Scientific EZO circuts and sensors.
The sensor class constructors for each are nearly identical, except for the class name.
In the most common setup, with hardware I2C, the only required argument for the constructor is the Arduino pin controlling power on/off; the i2cAddressHex is optional as is the number of readings to average.

@warning **You must isolate the data lines of all Atlas circuits from the main I2C bus if you wish to turn off their power!**
If you do not isolate them from your main I2C bus and you turn off power to the circuits between measurements the I2C lines will be pulled down to ground causing the I2C bus (and thus your logger) to crash.

The default I2C addresses for the circuits are:
- CO2: 0x69 (105)
- DO: 0x61 (97)
- EC (conductivity): 0x64 (100)
- ORP (redox): 0x62 (98)
- pH: 0x63 (99)
- RTD (temperature): 0x66 (102)
All of the circuits can be re-addressed to any other 8 bit number if desired.
To use multiple circuits of the same type, re-address them.

If for some reason you want or need to use software I2C, compile with the build flag `-D MS_ATLAS_SOFTWAREWIRE`.
The constructors for the software I2C implementation requires either the SCL and SDA pin numbers or a reference to the I2C object as arguments.
You must use Testato's [SoftwareWire](https://github.com/Testato/SoftwareWire) library for software I2C.
See the [software wire](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_softwarewire) section for an example of creating a software I2C instance to share between sensors.

@warning Either all or none of the Atlas sensors can be using software I2C.
Using some Altas sensors with software I2C and others with hardware I2C is not supported.

A custom variable code can be entered as a second argument in the variable constructors, and it is very strongly recommended that you use this otherwise it will be very difficult to determine which return is high and which is low range on the sensor.
If your ADD converter is not at the standard address of 0x48, you can enter its actual address as the third argument.
Do NOT forget that if you want to give a number of measurements to average, that comes _after_ the i2c address in the constructor!

Note that to access both the high and low range returns, two instances must be created, one at the low range return pin and one at the high pin.

### Keller RS485/Modbus Water Level Sensors

The next two sections are for Keller RS485/Modbus water level sensors.
The sensor class constructors for each are nearly identical, except for the class name.
The sensor constructors require as input: the sensor modbus address,  a stream instance for data (ie, `Serial`), and one or two power pins.
The Arduino pin controlling the receive and data enable on your RS485-to-TTL adapter and the number of readings to average are optional.
(Use -1 for the second power pin and -1 for the enable pin if these don't apply and you want to average more than one reading.)  Please see the section "[Notes on Arduino Streams and Software Serial](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/page_arduino_streams.html)" for more information about what streams can be used along with this library.
In tests on these sensors, SoftwareSerial_ExtInts _did not work_ to communicate with these sensors, because it isn't stable enough.
AltSoftSerial and HardwareSerial work fine.
Up to two power pins are provided so that the RS485 adapter, the sensor and/or an external power relay can be controlled separately.
If the power to everything is controlled by the same pin, use -1 for the second power pin or omit the argument.
If they are controlled by different pins _and no other sensors are dependent on power from either pin_ then the order of the pins doesn't matter.
If the RS485 adapter, sensor, or relay are controlled by different pins _and any other sensors are controlled by the same pins_ you should put the shared pin first and the un-shared pin second.
Both pins _cannot_ be shared pins.

Because older versions of these sensors all ship with the same I2C address, and more than one is frequently used at different soil depths in the same profile, this module has an optional dependence on Testato's [SoftwareWire](https://github.com/Testato/SoftwareWire) library for software I2C.

To use software I2C, compile with the build flag `-D MS_PALEOTERRA_SOFTWAREWIRE`.
See the [software wire](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_softwarewire) section for an example of creating a software I2C instance to share between sensors.

The constructors for the software I2C implementation requires either the SCL and SDA pin numbers or a reference to the I2C object as arguments.
All variants of the constructor require the Arduino power pin.
The I2C address can be given if it the sensor is not set to the default of 0x68.

All constructor arguments are optional, but the first argument is for the I2C address of the tip counter (if not 0x08) and the second is for the depth of rain (in mm) per tip event (if not 0.2mm).
Most metric tipping buckets are calibrated to have 1 tip per 0.2mm of rain.
Most English tipping buckets are calibrated to have 1 tip per 0.01" of rain, which is 0.254mm.

In Arduino coding, the classic "main" function is replaced by two functions: setup() and loop().
The setup() function runs once when the board boots or restarts.
It usually contains many functions that set the mode of input and output pins and prints out some debugging information to the serial port.
These functions are frequently named "begin".
Because we have a _lot_ of parts to set up, there's a lot going on in this function!

Let's break it down.

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_open Starting the Function )
### Starting the Function

First we just open the function definitions:

```cpp
void setup() {
```

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_wait Wait for USB )
### Wait for USB

Next we wait for the USB debugging port to initialize.
This only applies to SAMD and 32U4 boards that have built-in USB support.
This code should not be used for deployed loggers; it's only for using a USB for debugging.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_wait} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_prints Printing a Hello )
### Printing a Hello

Next we print a message out to the debugging port.
This is also just for debugging - it's very helpful when connected to the logger via USB to see a clear indication that the board is starting

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_prints} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_serial_interrupts Serial Interrupts )
### Serial Interrupts

If we're using either NeoSWSerial or SoftwareSerial_ExtInts we need to assign the data receiver pins to interrupt functionality here in the setup.

The [NeoSWSerial](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_neoswserial) and [SoftwareSerial_ExtInts](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_softwareseraial) objects were created way up in the [Extra Serial Ports](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_serial_ports) section.

**NOTE:**  If you create more than one NeoSWSerial or Software serial object, you need to call the enableInterrupt function for each Rx pin!

For NeoSWSerial we use:
```cpp
    enableInterrupt(neoSSerial1Rx, neoSSerial1ISR, CHANGE);
```

For SoftwareSerial with External interrupts we use:
```cpp
    enableInterrupt(softSerialRx, SoftwareSerial_ExtInts::handle_interrupt,
                    CHANGE);
```

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_serial_begin Serial Begin )
### Serial Begin

Every serial port setup and used in the program must be "begun" in the setup function.
This section calls the begin functions for all of the various ports defined in the [Extra Serial Ports](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_serial_ports) section

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_serial_begins} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_pin_periph SAMD Pin Peripherals )
### SAMD Pin Peripherals

After beginning all of the serial ports, we need to set the pin peripheral settings for any SERCOM's we assigned to serial functionality on the SAMD boards.
These were created in the [Extra Serial Ports](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_samd_serial_ports) section above.
This does not need to be done for an AVR board (like the Mayfly).

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_samd_pins} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_flash Flash the LEDs )
### Flash the LEDs

Like printing debugging information to the serial port, flashing the board LED's is a very helpful indication that the board just restarted.
Here we set the pin modes for the LED pins and flash them back and forth using the greenredflash() function we created back in the [working functions](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/menu_a_la_carte_8ino-example.html#enu_working) section.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_flashing_led} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_logger Begin the Logger )
### Begin the Logger

Next get ready and begin the logger.
We set the logger time zone and the clock time zone.
The clock time zone is what the RTC will report; the logger time zone is what will be written to the SD card and all data publishers.
The values are set with the `Logger::` prefix because they are static variables of the Logger class rather than member variables.
Here we also tie the logger and modem together and set all the logger pins.
Then we finally run the logger's begin function.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_logger} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_sensors Setup the Sensors )
### Setup the Sensors

After beginning the logger, we setup all the sensors.
Unlike all the previous chuncks of the setup that are preparation steps only requiring the mcu processor, this might involve powering up the sensors.
To prevent a low power restart loop, we put a battery voltage condition on the sensor setup.
This prevents a solar powered board whose battery has died from continuously restarting as soon as it gains any power on sunrise.
Without the condition the board would boot with power, try to power hungry sensors, brown out, and restart over and over.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_sesors} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_modem Custom Modem Setup )
### Custom Modem Setup

Next we can opt to do some special setup needed for a few of the modems.
You should only use the one chunk that applies to your specific modem configuration and delete the others.

[//]: # ( @subsubsection menu_setup_esp ESP8266 Baud Rate )
#### ESP8266 Baud Rate

This chunk of code reduces the baud rate of the ESP8266 from its default of 115200 to 9600.
This is only needed for 8MHz boards (like the Mayfly) that cannot communicate at 115200 baud.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_esp} )

[//]: # ( @subsubsection menu_setup_skywire Skywire Pin Inversions )
#### Skywire Pin Inversions

This chunk of code inverts the pin levels for status, wake, and reset of the modem.
This is necessary for the Skywire development board and some other breakouts.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_skywire} )

[//]: # ( @subsubsection menu_setup_xbeec_carrier XBee Cellular Carrier )
#### XBee Cellular Carrier

This chunk of code sets the carrier profile and network technology for a Digi XBee or XBee3.
You should change the lines with the `CP` and `N#` commands to the proper number to match your SIM card.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_xbeec_carrier} )

[//]: # ( @subsubsection setup_r4_carrrier SARA R4 Cellular Carrier )
#### SARA R4 Cellular Carrier

This chunk of code sets the carrier profile and network technology for a u-blox SARA R4 or N4 module, including a Sodaq R410 UBee or a Digi XBee3 LTE-M in bypass mode..
You should change the lines with the `UMNOPROF` and `URAT` commands to the proper number to match your SIM card.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_r4_carrrier} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_rtc Sync the Real Time Clock )
### Sync the Real Time Clock

After any special modem options, we can opt to use the modem to synchronize the real time clock with the NIST time servers.
This is very helpful in keeping the clock from drifting or resetting it if it lost time due to power loss.
Like the sensor setup, we also apply a battery voltage voltage condition before attempting the clock sync.
(All of the supported modems are large power eaters.)
Unlike the sensor setup, we have an additional check for "sanity" of the clock time.
To be considered "sane" the clock has to set somewhere between 2020 and 2025.
It's a broad range, but it will automatically flag values like Jan 1, 2000 - which are the default start value of the clock on power up.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_clock} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_file Setup a File on the SD card )
### Setup File on the SD card

We're getting close to the end of the setup function!
This section verifies that the SD card is communicating with the MCU and sets up a file on it for saved data.
Like with the sensors and the modem, we check for battery level before attempting to communicate with the SD card.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_file} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_sleep Sleep until the First Data Collection Time )
### Sleep until the First Data Collection Time

We're finally fished with setup!
This chunk puts the system into low power deep sleep until the next logging interval.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{setup_sleep} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_setup_done Setup Complete )
### Setup Complete

Set up is done!
This setup function is *really* long.
But don't forget you need to close it with a final curly brace.

```cpp
}
```

[//]: # ( @section menu_loop Arduino Loop Function )
## Arduino Loop Function

This is the loop function which will run repeatedly as long as the board is turned on.
**NOTE:**  This example has code for both a typical simple loop and a complex loop that calls lower level logger functions.
You should only pick _one_ loop function and delete the other.

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_simple_loop A Typical Loop )
### A Typical Loop

After the incredibly long setup function, we can do the vast majority of all logger work in a very simple loop function.
Every time the logger wakes we check the battery voltage and do 1 of three things:
1. If the battery is very low, go immediately back to sleep and hope the sun comes back out
2. If the battery is at a moderate level, attempt to collect data from sensors, but do not attempt to publish data.
The modem the biggest power user of the whole system.
3.
At full power, do everything.

[//]: # ( @menusnip{simple_loop} )

[//]: # ( @subsection menu_complex_loop A Complex Loop )
### A Complex Loop

If you need finer control over the steps of the logging function, this code demonstrates how the loop should be constructed.

Here are some guidelines for writing a loop function:

- If you want to log on an even interval, use `if (checkInterval())` or `if (checkMarkedInterval())` to verify that the current or marked time is an even interval of the logging interval..
- Call the `markTime()` function if you want associate with a two iterations of sensor updates with the same timestamp.
This allows you to use `checkMarkedInterval()` to check if an action should be preformed based on the exact time when the logger woke rather than upto several seconds later when iterating through sensors.
- Either:
  - Power up all of your sensors with `sensorsPowerUp()`.
  - Wake up all your sensors with `sensorsWake()`.
  - Update the values all the sensors in your VariableArray together with `updateAllSensors()`.
  - Immediately after running `updateAllSensors()`, put sensors to sleep to save power with `sensorsSleep()`.
  - Power down all of your sensors with `sensorsPowerDown()`.
- Or:
  - Do a full update loop of all sensors, including powering them with `completeUpdate()`.
(This combines the previous 5 functions.)
- After updating the sensors, then call any functions you want to send/print/save data.
- Finish by putting the logger back to sleep, if desired, with `systemSleep()`.

All together, this gives:

[//]: # ( @todo fix links )

If you need more help in writing a complex loop, the [double_logger example program](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/double_logger) demonstrates using a custom loop function in order to log two different groups of sensors at different logging intervals.
The [data_saving example program](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/data_saving) shows using a custom loop in order to save cellular data by saving data from many variables on the SD card, but only sending a portion of the data to the EnviroDIY data portal.
